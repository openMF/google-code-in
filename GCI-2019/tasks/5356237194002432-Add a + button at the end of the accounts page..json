Since applying for accounts is a very less used option, hence remove that button and add a new button at the end of the list.\n\nRemember, the add button with the most preferable UX(according to our maintainers) will be added.\n\n#### Steps to be followed by beginners\n\n1. Go to app > src > pages > accounts-page\n\n2. Open accounts.html\n\n3. Delete the line(S) which add the + button.\n\n4.  add the button at end of ion-list\n\n5. Submit the PR link as work submission.\n\n Find more about the buttons:- https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/button\n More about Icons:- https://ionicons.com/\n About git and making a PR:- https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github",
