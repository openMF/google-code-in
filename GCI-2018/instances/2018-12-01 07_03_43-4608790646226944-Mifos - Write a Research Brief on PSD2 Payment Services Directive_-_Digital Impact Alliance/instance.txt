Description: PSD2 is the second Payment Services Directive, designed by the countries of the European Union. It could revolutionise the payments industry, affecting everything from the way we pay online, to what information we see when making a payment.

It will have profound impact on the financial services sector in Europe and is being watched by other countries. It will have a huge impact on the open banking and open API movement as well.
