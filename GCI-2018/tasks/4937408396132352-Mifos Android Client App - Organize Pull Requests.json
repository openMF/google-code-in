    "description": "The objective is to separate the ready-to-be-merged Pull Requests (PR) from the others\n\n1. Go through the Android Client's [PR](https://github.com/openMF/android-client/pulls)\n2. Check if the PR has been reviewed by someone\n  a - If it has been reviewed, and no change has been asked by the reviewer, mark it Reviewed - Ready to be Merged\n  b - If it has been reviewed, and some change has been asked by the reviewer, mark it Reviewed - Changes Needed\n  c - If it has not been reviewed, mark it Reviewed - NEED REVIEW\n\nYou have to submit a spreadsheet (you can use Microsoft Excel or Libre Office or Google sheets etc) with four columns\n1. First column => link to the PR\n2. Second column => name/heading as mentioned in the PR\n3. The third column should be the Status as described in the description above. Use color coding:\n   a - Green => ready to be merged\n   b - Blue => Reviewed but changes needed\n   c - Red => Need Review\n4. Fourth column => Date on which you checked the status. \n5. The submission should have at least 15 records. More records will add to the weight of your task. However, duplicate records - adding the same PR more than once - will have a negative effect. \n\nIf you need help, you can either contact the mentor assigned for the task or contact the public channel for the Android Client.",
