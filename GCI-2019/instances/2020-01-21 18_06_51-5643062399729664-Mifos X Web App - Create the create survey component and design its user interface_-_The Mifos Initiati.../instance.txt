Title: Mifos X Web App - Create the create survey component and design its user interface
Description: ## Objective
The objective is to create the create survey component and design its user interface. You can use your creativity to enhance the UI, it is not necessary that it should look exactly similar to community app.

### Description
1. Create the create survey component under the system -> manage surveys section.
2. Connect it via routing from create survey button in manage surveys component so that its accessible.
3. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).
4. Design the user interface for the create survey component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness.
5. Implement the required API so a new survey can be created. Make sure after survey creation we are redirected back to surveys list view.
