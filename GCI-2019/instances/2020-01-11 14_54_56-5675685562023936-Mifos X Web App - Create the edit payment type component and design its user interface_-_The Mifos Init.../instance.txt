Title: Mifos X Web App - Create the edit payment type component and design its user interface
Description: ## Objective
The objective is to create the edit payment type component and design its user interface.

### Description
1. Create the edit payment type component under the organization -> payment types section.
2. Connect it via routing from edit payment type button in payment types table so that its accessible.
3. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).
4. Design the user interface for the edit payment type component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness.
5. Implement the required API so an existing payment type can be updated. Make sure after payment type is updated we are redirected back to payment types list view.
6. Write comments for the implemented component.
