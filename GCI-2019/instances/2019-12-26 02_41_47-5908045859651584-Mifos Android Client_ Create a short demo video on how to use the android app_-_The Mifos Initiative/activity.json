        "text": "So first of all, Merry Christmas & later Happy New Year! (If you are in the same timezone as me/US). Thank you for grading my work, here is my YouTube URL:\n\nThe app is truly great, I absolutely love to see this app actually is in the google app store. This app is really powerful. However, there is a few feedback/recommendation to this app while I was recording: https://youtu.be/dwAsnwPwzbw\n\n1. Last Name: When registering a client, the client's last name must greater than 3 characters. However, my last name happened to be just 3 characters. So I suggest the minimum character should be at least 2 characters.\n\n2. Upload document: When I try to upload a PDF document that size is 3KB, the app keeps crashing for some reason, however, I can upload signature via straight write on the pad.\n\n3. Group and Center: There is no group associated with any centers. I would like to hope there is a feature when you create a group, it asks do you want to associate to any center or not.\n\n4. Login/Loan: During recording, I can't log in using mifos as username, password as password, sometimes it just keeps not log me in. Also, when I try to pay a loan, sometimes I can pay it successfully.\n\n5. Passcode: Passcode should change to only need setup once unless you need to change the passcode. Because every time I log in, it asks me to set up a passcode.\n\n6. Wiki Update (https://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/84476000/Working+with+Center+Lists): I suggest a Wiki update on working with center lists. Because there is no more search button, and if I long click a center, it won't show a calendar, instead, it shows a sync button on the top-right corner. \n\nThanks for grading my work, I'm sorry that I know nothing on Java (yet). So I can't help to fix the issues. But thank you and Merry Christmas!",
