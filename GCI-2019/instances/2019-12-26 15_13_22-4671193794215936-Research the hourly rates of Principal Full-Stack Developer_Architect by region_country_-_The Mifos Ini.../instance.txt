Title: Research the hourly rates of Principal Full-Stack Developer/Architect by region/country
Description: ## Objective 
As part of the documentation of the social impact of our initiative, we want to assign a dollar value to the contributions we receive from our volunteers. These volunteers come from a range of fields, experience levels, and locations. For this task, we're gathering data on Principal full-stack developers/Architects (10+ year's experience)

We will also use this research to understand the market rates for consultants by region. This is valuable data for when we are offering consulting services to generate revenue to help with long-term sustainability of the Mifos Initiative.

So we need to gather data points on Principal Full Stack Developers by country/region by level of experience, web, etc. They should have experience using scripting languages such JavaScript frameworks, Backend technologies such as Node, Java etc.

You can use websites like glassdoor, payscale, salary explorer to do the research. You should document your findings in a Google Sheet and any other corresponding materials.
