Title: Mifos X Community App - Bug Fix: Some Fields still show 'Required field' even after inputting the value

Some Date Picker Fields show 'Required field' even after inputting the value. Most of the time, this issue arises when data picker field is empty, that is not filled by the system.

Required field error should not be shown if value is present in the fields.
