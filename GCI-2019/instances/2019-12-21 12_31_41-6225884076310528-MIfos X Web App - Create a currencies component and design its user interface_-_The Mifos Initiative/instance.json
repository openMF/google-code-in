    "description": "## Objective\nThe objective is to create a currencies component and design its user interface. [Task is dependent on creation of Organization module for routing to work, so we would highly encourage you to take that task up first. However, if you choose to perform this task first follow the description below accordingly.]\n\n### Description\n1. Create a currencies component under the organization section. If organization module does not exist yet, create it within the app folder.\n2. Connect it via routing from organization component (if it exits, else via app routing module) so that its accessible.\n3. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).\n4. Design the user interface for the currencies component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness.\n5. Fetch the data by implementing the required API and populate the table. Make sure searching and sorting works.\n6. Write comments for the implemented component.\n\n#### References\nYou may have a look at the current implemented components in `accounting`, `system` or `products` section for reference.\n\n## How to get help \nIf you need help, be sure to post your question to our [developer mailing list](http://mifos.org/resources/community/communications/#mailing-lists) or ask in our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/openMF/web-app).\n\nAll the best! Do remember, quality over quantity is the key."
