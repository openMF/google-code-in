Description: ## Objective
Your task is to create a short demo video which explains to a user how to use the app. 

## Description

You will have to first [build](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25348339/how-to-import-an-existing-project-from-github-into-android-studio) the app from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openMF/android-client). After this, to create the video you have to take a screencast of the app.  

The video should cover all the features present in the app including the ones that were added recently. You can find a sample [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RpfL_9BUIM). The sample video was created by a GCI participant in the previous year.
