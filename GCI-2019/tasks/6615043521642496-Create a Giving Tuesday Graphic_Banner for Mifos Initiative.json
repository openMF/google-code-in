For facebook, 1200x630 pixels is ideal.\n\nSubmit your artwork in both .jpg and .png format and please include the native file (.ai, .psd, or .eps) file format. \n\nMifos logos can be found at https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByeK44WJrHIvYnk1M0ZFemJSNkE.\nGiving Tuesday logos can be found at https://www.givingtuesday.org/logos\n\nAlso, append your name to the submitted file here, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DOWBCUw54XP1g7p03FjD_33hVtPb_ABn, so that we know who did the work.",
