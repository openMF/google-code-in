The prototype is done and can be found here: [show prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/8581e34d-8b91-49ec-7c21-000d98c8f18b-f3b0/?hints=off), and source files here: [show repository](https://github.com/letelete/mifos-pay-app-design). We will be working on the redesign implementation now.\n\nThis issue is about redesigning an edit profile section.\n\nThat's what we want to achieve:\n\n**NOTICE** \n\nThe edit profile button is removed from the profile section, so just implement some temporary button to open the edit profile fragment. Remember to delete it when you will finish your work.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18665370/49589360-813de680-f969-11e8-8a54-da3bae1684bf.png)",
