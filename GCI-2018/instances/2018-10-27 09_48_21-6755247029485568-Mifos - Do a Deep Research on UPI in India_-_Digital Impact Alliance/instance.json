    "description": "### Summary\nUPI in India is growing at a very fast pace. Hence, it has become a very important thing in FinTech sector in India. So in this task you have to do a extensive research that what are the technologies behind it, why it is growing so fast (numeric and statistical data would be a bonus), how it works etc. The report should be in layman terms so that anyone who is not much familiar with the payment system in India can also understand that.\n\n### Bonus\nIf you could also make a small FAQ to explain UPI in layman terms.\n\nMore Info about UPI: [NPCI](https://www.npci.org.in/)\n\n**Note:** You could either write the research report on some cloud service like Google Doc or you would simply upload your doc file here."
