Title: Mifos - Do a Deep Research on UPI in India
Description: ### Summary

So in this task you have to do a extensive research that what are the technologies behind it, why it is growing so fast (numeric and statistical data would be a bonus), how it works etc. The report should be in layman terms so that anyone who is not much familiar with the payment system in India can also understand that.

### Bonus
If you could also make a small FAQ to explain UPI in layman terms.
