    "description": "**NOTICE** \n\n**Remember to checkout and send a pull request to the [redesign](https://github.com/openMF/mobile-wallet/tree/redesign)  branch.**\n\n---\n\nWe are working on the app redesign. The prototype is done and can be found here: [show prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/8581e34d-8b91-49ec-7c21-000d98c8f18b-f3b0/?hints=off), and source files here: [show repository](https://github.com/letelete/mifos-pay-app-design). We will be working on the redesign implementation now.\n\nThis issue is about creating a connection between EditProfile and Profile.\n\nThat's what we want to achieve:\n\n1.  Open EditProfile activity on the Edit Profile button click\n\n2. As soon as user left from the EditProfile activity, data in the Account Details section should update itself.\n\n3. User should be able to change his profile image by tapping on it not only from the EditProfile section. We want to make changing image possible by tapping on it from the Profile section too.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18665370/49687966-6acf9080-fb0b-11e8-9ded-21c6ec3cb356.png)",
