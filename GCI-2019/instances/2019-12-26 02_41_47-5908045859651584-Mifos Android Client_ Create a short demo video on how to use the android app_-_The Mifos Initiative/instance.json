    "description": "## Objective\nYour task is to create a short demo video which explains to a user how to use the app. \n\n## Description\n\nYou will have to first [build](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25348339/how-to-import-an-existing-project-from-github-into-android-studio) the app from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openMF/android-client). After this, to create the video you have to take a screencast of the app.  \n\nThe video should cover all the features present in the app including the ones that were added recently. You can find a sample [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RpfL_9BUIM). The sample video was created by a GCI participant in the previous year.\n \nYou can use any video editing software of your choice.\n\nAfter making the video, upload it on YouTube and send us the link as a reply to this task. \n\n## References\n\nYou can find the user guide [here](https://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/76873780/Mifos+Android+Client+User+Guide).\n\nThe latest features that were added to the app can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/moksh-mahajan/cf080d66b72659713dbc8336ca19976e).\n\n[This StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25348339/how-to-import-an-existing-project-from-github-into-android-studio) explains how to build an android project by importing it from GitHub.\n\n## Need help? \n\nIf you need help, you can ask any question as a reply to this task or you can post your question to our [developer mailing list](http://mifos.org/resources/community/communications/#mailing-lists) or ask in our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/openMF/android-client).
