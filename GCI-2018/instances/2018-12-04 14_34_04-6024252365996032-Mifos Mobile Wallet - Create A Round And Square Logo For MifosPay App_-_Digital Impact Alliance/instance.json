    "description": "MifosPay doesn\u2019t have a logo of its own. The objective is to create a round and a square logo for MifosPay App. Some Suggestions - Try playing letter \u2018M\u2019 and \u2018P\u2019 with something like money. It is only a suggestion and you can create it differently too. Also, the best logo chosen will be the official logo for the MifosPay App. You have to submit a high res, native file of the logo as well as png (transparent)  and jpg of logo. \nIf you need help, be sure to post your question to our [developer mailing list](http://mifos.org/resources/community/communications/#mailing-lists) or email the corresponding mentors assigned to the task or you can message on [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/openMF/mifos) too.\n\nHigh Resolution Mifos Logo - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByeK44WJrHIvYnk1M0ZFemJSNkE"
