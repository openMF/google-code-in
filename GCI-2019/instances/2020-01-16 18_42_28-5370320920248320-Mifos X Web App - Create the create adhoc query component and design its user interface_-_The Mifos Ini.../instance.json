    "description": "## Objective\nThe objective is to create the create adhoc query component and design its user interface.\n\n### Description\n1. Create the create adhoc query component under the organization -> adhoc query section.\n2. Connect it via routing from create adhoc query button in adhoc query component so that its accessible.\n3. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).\n4. Design the user interface for the create adhoc query component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness.\n5. Implement the required API so a new adhoc query can be created. Make sure after adhoc query creation we are redirected back to adhoc query list view if view adhoc query component does not exist at the time of implementation of this component.\n6. Write comments for the implemented component.\n\n#### References\nYou may have a look at the current implemented components in `accounting`, `system` or `products` section for reference.\n\n## How to get help \nIf you need help, be sure to post your question to our [developer mailing list](http://mifos.org/resources/community/communications/#mailing-lists) or ask in our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/openMF/web-app).\n\nAll the best! Do remember, quality over quantity is the key."
