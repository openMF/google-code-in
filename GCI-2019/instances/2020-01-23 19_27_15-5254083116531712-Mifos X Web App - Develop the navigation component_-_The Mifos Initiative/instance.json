    "description": "## Objective\nThe objective is to develop the navigation component. You can use your creativity to enhance the UI, it is not necessary that it should look exactly similar to community app.\n\n### Description\n1. Develop the navigation component. Use angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness. (mat-tree has been used in Accounting -> Chart of Accounts and might be helpful for implementation as an example)\n2. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).\n3. Implement the required APIs for the component.\n4. Write comments for the implemented component.\n\n#### References\nYou may have a look at the current implemented components in `accounting`, `system` or `products` section for reference.\n\n## How to get help \nIf you need help, be sure to post your question to our [developer mailing list](http://mifos.org/resources/community/communications/#mailing-lists) or ask in our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/openMF/web-app).\n\nAll the best! Do remember, quality over quantity is the key."
