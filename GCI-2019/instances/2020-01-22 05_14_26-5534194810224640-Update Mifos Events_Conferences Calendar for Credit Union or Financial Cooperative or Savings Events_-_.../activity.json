        "text": "Hi mentors, this is my final task claimed for GCI-2019. I worked on row # 381-390. Please check. Thanks.\n\nAlso, since this is the final task I claimed, I would like to make a few comments about The Mifos Initiative. \n\nFirst, I'm really grateful for working with Mifos. It teaches me a lesson, a lesson more important than the contest itself. A lesson on open-source, a lesson on \"think more on other people than just yourself\" (said by a winner of GCI-2018). And Mifos, fully let me feel that.\n\nTo express the thanks I have for Mifos, I created a short Thank You video. You can see here: https://youtu.be/e3GBuB0Ysd8, Also a medium article describes what tasks I have done in GCI-2019: https://bit.ly/38uSvZI\n\nI would like to specifically thanks to three mentors:\n1. Ed Cable - CEO, thanks for organizing Mifos' part in GCI-2019.\n2. Abhaychawla - Coding mentor, I didn't work on a lot of coding tasks, but just from one task that I completed, I felt this mentor is really nice and patient, explain the error to me as detail as possible.\n3. luphieanza (which is the mentor who is most likely seeing this comment) - You are the best mentor I ever encountered in GCI-2019. You are really patient, nice, kind, and kindly provide me feedback on how to improve my work. This mentor also compliments me a lot. I worked with this mentor the most (fintech research, salary research, video). And I'm really glad this mentor is part of Mifos' organization. \n\nFew recommendations I would make to Mifos:\n1. Error management: I wish someone can help me more on how to get PPI vision credentials set up. It keeps telling me invalid credentials no matter what I tried so I can record a video.\n2. Gitter Community Chat: Officials should respond to the Gitter chat more frequently.\n3. More variety of tasks: Unless other organizations, Mifos offered not a lot of variety of tasks. And I believe Mifos should add more tasks.\n\nSo since the letter limited is almost reaches, I just want to say. Thank you Mifos!! :) :) :)",
