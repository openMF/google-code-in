Title: Redesign Finances Tab of Mifos Pay app
Description: **NOTICE** 

**Remember to checkout and send a pull request to the [redesign](https://github.com/openMF/mobile-wallet/tree/redesign)  branch.**

---

We are working on the app redesign. The prototype is done and can be found here: [show prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/8581e34d-8b91-49ec-7c21-000d98c8f18b-f3b0/?hints=off), and source files here: [show repository](https://github.com/letelete/mifos-pay-app-design). We will be working on the redesign implementation now.

This issue is about **preparing** a layout for the Finance section redesign and new features implementation. You will need to create a fragment for finances and tab layout for sections (Leave tabs empty for now), prepare fragments for the sections and check if you can easily move around these tabs.

**NOTICE** This issue is NOT about redesigning a layout or implementing new features, and only about preparing Finance section for that.

That's what we want to achieve:
