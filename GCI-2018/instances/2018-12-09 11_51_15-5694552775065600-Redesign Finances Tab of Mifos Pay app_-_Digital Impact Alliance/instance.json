    "description": "**NOTICE** \n\n**Remember to checkout and send a pull request to the [redesign](https://github.com/openMF/mobile-wallet/tree/redesign)  branch.**\n\n---\n\nWe are working on the app redesign. The prototype is done and can be found here: [show prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/8581e34d-8b91-49ec-7c21-000d98c8f18b-f3b0/?hints=off), and source files here: [show repository](https://github.com/letelete/mifos-pay-app-design). We will be working on the redesign implementation now.\n\nThis issue is about **preparing** a layout for the Finance section redesign and new features implementation. You will need to create a fragment for finances and tab layout for sections (Leave tabs empty for now), prepare fragments for the sections and check if you can easily move around these tabs.\n\n**NOTICE** This issue is NOT about redesigning a layout or implementing new features, and only about preparing Finance section for that.\n\nThat's what we want to achieve:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18665370/49590184-80a64f80-f96b-11e8-9b86-43d431dcc91f.png)"
