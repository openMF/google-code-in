Title: Redesign Edit Profile Section of Mifos Pay App
Description: **NOTICE** 

**Remember to checkout and send a pull request to the [redesign](https://github.com/openMF/mobile-wallet/tree/redesign)  branch.**

---

We are working on the app redesign. The prototype is done and can be found here: [show prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/8581e34d-8b91-49ec-7c21-000d98c8f18b-f3b0/?hints=off), and source files here: [show repository](https://github.com/letelete/mifos-pay-app-design). We will be working on the redesign implementation now.

This issue is about redesigning an edit profile section.

That's what we want to achieve:

**NOTICE** 

The edit profile button is removed from the profile section, so just implement some temporary button to open the edit profile fragment. Remember to delete it when you will finish your work.
