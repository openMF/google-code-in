    "description": "**Summary:**\n\nWhen I tried to send money to other random UPI address, it is showing error in Toast \u2018Error fetching Receiver\u2019. Firstly, it should be shown in SnackBar and the error should be more clear like \u2018Error finding Virtual Payment Address\u2019 and the loader goes off in a infinite loop.\n\nAlso, the wallet balance at that time was 0 so my suggestion is that we should first check if balance is enough and then find the receiver.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\nKeep wallet Balance 0.\n\nDashboard -> Transfer (Send) -> Enter a Random UPI Address and amount greater than balance (in our case greater than 0)\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nThe app should firstly search for if balance is enough or not and then if receiver is not find, the error should be shown in a SnackBar with a error message something like `Error finding Virtual Payment Address`.\n\n**Observed behavior:**\n\nThe firstly searches for a receiver without taking care of balance. Also, shows the error message in a Toast \u2018Error fetching Receiver\u2019."
