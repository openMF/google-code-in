Title: Mifos X Web App - Create an employees component and design its user interface
Description: ## Objective
The objective is to create an employees component and design its user interface. [Task is dependent on creation of Organization module for routing to work, so we would highly encourage you to take that task up first. However, if you choose to perform this task first follow the description below accordingly.]

### Description
1. Create an employees component under the organization section. If organization module does not exist yet, create it within the app folder.
2. Connect it via routing from organization component (if it exits, else via app routing module) so that its accessible.
3. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).
4. Design the user interface for the employees component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness.
5. Fetch the data by implementing the required API and populate the table. Make sure searching and sorting works.
6. Write comments for the implemented component.

#### References
You may have a look at the current implemented components in `accounting`, `system` or `products` section for reference.
