Title: Mifos - Convert PPI Scorecard and Lookup Tables for Three Countries
Description: ## Objective 
The PPI (Poverty Probability Index) is a ten-question survey with lookup tables to assess how much a client a is moving out of poverty. It's a valuable social impact measurement tool and we have support in Mifos for capturing these surveys. However the surveys must be in XML format. Please refer to the main ticket https://mifosforge.jira.com/browse/MIFOSX-2407 and complete the manual conversion process for three countries starting from the top of the list and moving down working on the sub-tasks that aren't in progress or resolved.
