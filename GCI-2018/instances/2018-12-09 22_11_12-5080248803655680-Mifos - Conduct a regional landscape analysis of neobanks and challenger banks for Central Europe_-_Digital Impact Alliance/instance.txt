Title: Mifos - Conduct a regional landscape analysis of neobanks and challenger banks for Central Europe
Description: ## Objective ##
As the functional footprint and support for digital financial services within Mifos/Fineract extends with our brand new Fineract CN architecture, a new target market for adoption of our software is the growing class of neobanks and challenger banks starting up. Across each region we'd like to make a comprehensive database of these leading new banks so we can track the sector and build awareness amongst the major players. This page has a [nice defnition and overview of these banks](https://www.paconsulting.com/insights/what-is-a-neobank-really/).
