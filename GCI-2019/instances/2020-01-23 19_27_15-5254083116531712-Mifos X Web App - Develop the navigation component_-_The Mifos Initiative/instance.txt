Title: Mifos X Web App - Develop the navigation component
Description: ## Objective
The objective is to develop the navigation component. You can use your creativity to enhance the UI, it is not necessary that it should look exactly similar to community app.

### Description
1. Develop the navigation component. Use angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness. (mat-tree has been used in Accounting -> Chart of Accounts and might be helpful for implementation as an example)
2. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).
3. Implement the required APIs for the component.
4. Write comments for the implemented component.

#### References
You may have a look at the current implemented components in `accounting`, `system` or `products` section for reference.
