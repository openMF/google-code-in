Title: Create a New Year's Greeting Card/Banner for Mifos Initiative
Description: This task involves designing a greeting card for Mifos, wishing Happy New Year. Make it look good, something you'd be proud to show to family and friends. Look at some great sticker design before you start working on this.

Submit your artwork in any file format, ideally with transparency settings so we can print them. 

Make several sizes so they can be used as header photos for our Social Media pages or email banners, etc. The ideal size for banners is 600 to 700 pixels wide and 100-200 pixels high.

Mifos logos can be found at https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByeK44WJrHIvYnk1M0ZFemJSNkE

Also, append your name to the submitted file here, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DOWBCUw54XP1g7p03FjD_33hVtPb_ABn,  so that we know who did the work.
