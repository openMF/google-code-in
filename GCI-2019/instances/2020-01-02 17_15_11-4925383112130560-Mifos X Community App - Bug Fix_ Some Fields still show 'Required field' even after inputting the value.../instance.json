Most of the time, this issue arises when data picker field is empty, that is not filled by the system.\n\n### Expected Behaviour:\nRequired field error should not be shown if value is present in the fields.\n\n### How to Submit\nSubmit a pull request linking to the issue and include the link to the pull request in your submission through the GCI Portal.\n\n## How to get help \r\nIf you need help, be sure to post your question to our [developer mailing list](http://mifos.org/resources/community/communications/#mailing-lists) or ask in our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/openMF/community-app)."
