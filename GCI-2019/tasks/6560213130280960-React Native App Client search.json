    "description": "Related to the previous React Native task. We would like to have a react native ios/android client search. The app starts with a search screen:\n1.  the user search the client in a textbox \n2.  the result has been paginated.\n3.  when the user click in one item, we get the client details.\n4. In the search result we provide buttons for (create/update/delete/) the selected client (even if we dont implement them).",
