Sadly however, for this particular job and experience level, not much information was given about the language. I tried going back for more information and included it wherever possible. In addition, I have increased the font size and changed it to \"Quicksand\" which according to various sources is a very legible font that is easy to read on mobile devices or small screens, so I hope it will be more convenient for you. Thank you, and I hope these changes are more to your liking. \n\nLink: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p9V5yfUR0TgKzmx4vIkGlMU7pe8J_oqxxQBmg-jEEdM/edit?usp=sharing",

Major countries (defined in task) are underlined, indented, and are the first ones listed per region. Borders divide each by region.\n2. Profession: First choice will always either be Full Stack Developer, Full Stack Software Developer or a type of Architect (either Software Architect or Design Architect) as defined in the task. If none of those options are available, Sr. Software Engineer is the next choice, then Software Engineer.\n3. Experience: Since task said it should be 10+yr experience level, Experienced (which is about 10-18yrs) is the closest and is the one used.\n4. If the Hourly/Yearly rate has a \"*\", it means the amount was manually found.\n5. If the category is listed as N/A, it means that the info could not be found.\n6. All sources are from payscale to keep data consistent and therefore more comparable.\n\nLink: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p9V5yfUR0TgKzmx4vIkGlMU7pe8J_oqxxQBmg-jEEdM/edit?usp=sharing",
