Title: Mifos X Web App - Develop the tree view for offices component
Description: ## Objective
The objective is to develop the tree view for offices component.

### Description
1. Develop the tree view for offices component. Use angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness. (mat-tree has been used in Accounting -> Chart of Accounts and might be helpful for implementation as an example)
2. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).
3. Implement the required APIs for the component.
4. Write comments for the implemented component.

#### References
You may have a look at the current implemented components in `accounting`, `system` or `products` section for reference.
