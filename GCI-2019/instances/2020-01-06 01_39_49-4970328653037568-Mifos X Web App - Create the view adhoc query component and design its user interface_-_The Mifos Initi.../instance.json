    "description": "## Objective\nThe objective is to create the view adhoc query component and design its user interface.\n\n### Description\n1. Create the view adhoc query component under the organization -> adhoc query section.\n2. Connect it via routing from adhoc query table in adhoc query component so that its accessible.\n3. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).\n4. Design the user interface for the view adhoc query component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness. (Use Angular Material Typography instead of SCSS wherever possible, refer more recently created components for reference)\n5. Fetch the data of adhoc query by implementing the required API.\n6. Implement required API for deletion of adhoc query. \n7. Write comments for the implemented component.\n\n#### References\nYou may have a look at the current implemented components in `accounting`, `system` or `products` section for reference.\n\n## How to get help \nIf you need help, be sure to post your question to our [developer mailing list](http://mifos.org/resources/community/communications/#mailing-lists) or ask in our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/openMF/web-app).\n\nAll the best! Do remember, quality over quantity is the key."
