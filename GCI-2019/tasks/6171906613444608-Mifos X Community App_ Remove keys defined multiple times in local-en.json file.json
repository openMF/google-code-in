    "description": "## Objective\nThe objective is to remove the keys defined multiple time in the local-en.json file of the Mifos Community App.\n\n### Description\n\nProblems:\n1. The `keys` in the file local-en.json in the global-translations folder has been defined multiple times which only creates complexity and increased the length of the file. For example, the key `Buttons` has been defined about 14 times in the same file which is of no use. This task aims to decrease the redundancy of the keys in the same file.\n\nExpected Behaviour:\n1. Every key should be present only once in the file.\n\nRelated files:\n1. Open the `local-en.json` file in any text editor(preferably VS Code) and search for the keys repeated in the file. \n\nLinks:\n1. Project: https://github.com/openMF/community-app\n2.
