For that, we made a task on submitting Usability Research Report on Mifos Mobile CN and one of the students suggested to redesign the app and gave some amazing mockups to work on.\n\n## What to do\n\nYou have to create the add beneficiaries and show beneficiaries screen according to mockup given on Github issue. Send your Pull Request on redesign branch.\n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yFR19vGlKW-amxzGms8TgPzd1jWkrALPFcaC85EyYpw/edit?usp=sharing) are the slides and [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rchih7z_oRz0RyMnByV1JWZjqDsqzhk-/view?usp=sharing) is the prototype video that the student submitted for the references."
