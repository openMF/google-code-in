Create a bulk import module and component in the app folder.\n2. Connect the component via routing from organization -> bulk import so that its accessible. **Note:** Explore the possibility of lazy loading this module and implement accordingly.\n3. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).\n4. Design the user interface for the bulk import component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness.\n5. Write comments for the implemented module and component.\n\n#### References\nYou may have a look at the current implemented components in `accounting`, `system` or `products` section for reference.\n\n## How to get help \nIf you need help, be sure to post your question to our [developer mailing list](http://mifos.org/resources/community/communications/#mailing-lists) or ask in our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/openMF/web-app).\n\nAll the best!
