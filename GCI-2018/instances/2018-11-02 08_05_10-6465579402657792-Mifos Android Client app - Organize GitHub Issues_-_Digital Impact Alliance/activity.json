Open issues (e.g. - https://github.com/openMF/android-client/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue)\n\n2. Closed issues (e.g - https://github.com/openMF/android-client/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)\n\nOpen issues are those issues which are have been reported but may or may not have been solved. Open issues have a green \"open\" tag below the issue title. Open issues are quite important as they tell us what our product lacks.\n\nClosed issues on the other hand are those which have been either resolved or are irrelevant to the project and hence are not that useful to us.\n\nThe task that you have taken up, requires you to classify open issues. You have to classify open issues as -\n\n1. Open\n2. In-progress\n3. Closed\n\nThe criteria for classifying the issues have been mentioned in the task itself. You have to \"only\" classify open issues (issues with the green tag) and not closed issues (issues with the red tag). \n\nThe sheet which you have shared with us contains closed issues, which is of no use to us. You have entered closed issues in the following cells - \n\n1. 23A\n2. 19A\n\nCan you please remove them and include only open issues in the sheet? \n\nFor your reference, I am providing you with examples for each of the classifications mentioned in the task - \n\n1. Open (e.g - https://github.com/openMF/android-client/issues/982)\n2. In-progress (e.g - https://github.com/openMF/android-client/issues/940)\n3. Closed (e.g - https://github.com/openMF/android-client/issues/835)\n\nPlease notice that all the issues mentioned above are open issues. \n\nCan you please make these changes and then get back to us?  :)\n\nAlso, if you have any difficulty in understanding the task please let us know. We'll help you out.\n\nI'm really sorry for the delay in my response. Please excuse me.",

An \"open issue\" can be classified as closed if someone has sent a pull request and that pull request got merged. \n\nHere is an example - \nhttps://github.com/openMF/android-client/issues/835  \n\nI noticed that you have also labelled a few issues incorrectly. Can you please change them as well? For the issues mentioned in cell 33A, 17A a pull request has already been sent, hence it's status should be \"in=progress\" (i.e \"blue\" and not \"green\")\n\nCan you please make these changes and then get back to us? :)",

I'm taking the example of the first link (Issue #999) in the sheet you shared. There, the PR has been sent which is open (note again, the PR is open) which means that the issue falls in 'In progress' or Blue category. Let me know if you still have any confusion regarding labelling. \n\nAlso, add a legend or texts with the background of the cell coloured with the label-colour to make it convenient for someone to understand.",
