Title: Mifos - Create a Year-End Giving Graphic/Banner for Mifos Initiative
Description: This task involves designing a graphic/banner for Mifos to help us promote via email and social media, donations for end of year giving. 

Make it look good, something you'd be proud to show to family and friends. We'd love to be able to use this in our email banners that we send out this year and on social media so please include multiple sizes of your design.

The ideal size for banners is 600 to 700 pixels wide and 100-200 pixels high. For instagram, dimensions should be 1080x1080. For facebook, 1200x630 pixels is ideal.

Submit your artwork in both .jpg and .png format and please include the native file (.ai, .psd, or .eps) file format. 

Mifos logos can be found at https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByeK44WJrHIvYnk1M0ZFemJSNkE.

Also, append your name to the submitted file here, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rEuaYW6NS3I50tGLYtCAkRVJEzeBMJwY, so that we know who did the work.
