Title: Mifos - FINERACT-632 - Description in Saving Product should not be mandatory
Description: The description field in savings product should not be mandatory. The UI is correct in showing that it shouldn't be mandatory but on the back-end the validation is enforcing that a value be added there.

To test out go to https://demo.openmf.org (mifos/password). Go to Admin --> Products --> Savings Products --> Create New. Try to create a savings product by just filling out all the mandatory fields. Upon submission you will receive error.

This task involves removing the distinction this requiring this field to be mandatory
