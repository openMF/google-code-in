Please go through each XML and Java file manually to find hard-coded strings.\n\nRemoving hard-coded strings is a good practice to be followed and often developers while developing new features leave them as hard-coded strings only.\n\n## What to do\n\nDo changes locally and then push them to the repository as Pull Request.",
