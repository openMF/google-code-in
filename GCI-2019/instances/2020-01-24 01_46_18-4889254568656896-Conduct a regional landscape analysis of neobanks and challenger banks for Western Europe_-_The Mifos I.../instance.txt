Title: Conduct a regional landscape analysis of neobanks and challenger banks for Western Europe
Description: ## Objective ##
As the functional footprint and support for digital financial services within Mifos/Fineract extends with our brand new Fineract CN architecture, a new target market for adoption of our software is the growing class of neobanks and challenger banks starting up. Across each region we'd like to make a comprehensive database of these leading new banks so we can track the sector and build awareness amongst the major players. This page has a [nice defnition and overview of these banks](https://www.paconsulting.com/insights/what-is-a-neobank-really/).

##Work to Do##
Each task is focused on one region and for that region, you should research ten challenger/neo-banks, filling out the corresponding details in the Google Sheet linked to this page. 

The details for each bank to record include: 
* Website, Email, URL for LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter
* Regions/Countries Served
* Target Market & Focus on Financial Inclusion
* Number of Customers, Portfolio Size
* Current Level of Investment, Growth Rate, Launch Date
