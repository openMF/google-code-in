    "description": "Mifos Pay doesn\u2019t have a logo of its own. The objective is to create a round and a square logo for Mifos Pay App. \n\nSome Suggestions - Try playing letter \u2018M\u2019 and \u2018P\u2019 with something like 'money'. Although, It's purely a suggestion and you are completely free to apply your creativity in creating the logo. Just make sure that your designed logo is relevant to title and idea of this app.  \n\nAlso, the best logo chosen will be the official logo for the Mifos Pay App. \n\nYou have to submit a high resolution, native file of the logo as well as PNG (transparent) and JPG formats of the logo.\n\nIf you need help, don't hesitate to post your question to our developer mailing list or email the corresponding mentors assigned to the task or you can message on [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/openMF/mifos) too.\n\nHigh Resolution Mifos Logo - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByeK44WJrHIvYnk1M0ZFemJSNkE"
