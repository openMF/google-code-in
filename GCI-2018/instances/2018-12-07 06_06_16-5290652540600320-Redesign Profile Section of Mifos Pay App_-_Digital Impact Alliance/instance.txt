Title: Redesign Profile Section of Mifos Pay App
Description: **NOTICE** 

**Remember to checkout and send a pull request to the [redesign](https://github.com/openMF/mobile-wallet/tree/redesign)  branch.**

---

We are working on the app redesign. The prototype is done and can be found here: [show prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/8581e34d-8b91-49ec-7c21-000d98c8f18b-f3b0/?hints=off), and source files here: [show repository](https://github.com/letelete/mifos-pay-app-design). We will be working on the redesign implementation now.

This issue is about redesigning a profile section.

**NOTICE** Don't implement the connection between edit profile yet. We will add it when the edit profile layout will be redesigned. Just add methods like OnClick and leave a `// TODO: EDIT PROFILE` comment. 

That's what we want to achieve:

* Add OnClick method for the user image
* Add onClick method for the `EDIT PROFILE` button
