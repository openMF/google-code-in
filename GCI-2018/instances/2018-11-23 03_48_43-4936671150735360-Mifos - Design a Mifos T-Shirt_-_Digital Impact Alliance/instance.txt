Title: Mifos - Design a Mifos T-Shirt
Description: SWAG is one of our best tools to motivate volunteers and community members. We like to have a shirt available to give to volunteers, sell at conferences or use for the official shirts of our conferences that we organize.

In short, a Mifos t-shirt is highly valued by our community and we'd love for the design to be top-notch. Your creativity can go a long ways and lot of eyes will be on your design. 

The design of the t-shirt should have both a tech feel as well as some of the warmth of a non-profit to it. You can experiment with a multi-color design but sometimes for budget reasons we have to do a single color print so bear that in mind with your design.

 Deliverable for this would be a high-res illustrator or photoshop file of the design along with .jpg/png files. 

For this task, you would have the freedom to design what you want but it should communicate across collaboration, community, empowerment, financial inclusion, solidarity, innovation, technology. working on a common platform, unity, peer support., diversity given our community is completely global, flexibility and freedom of open source. It could tie in elements of technology like software code/bits and bytes, mobile phones, cloud computing. It could tie in elements of microfinance like different forms of currency, villages, microbusinesses like farming, artisanry, etc.
