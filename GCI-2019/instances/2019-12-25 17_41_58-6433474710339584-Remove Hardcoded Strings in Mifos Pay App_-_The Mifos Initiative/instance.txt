Title: Remove Hardcoded Strings in Mifos Pay App
Description: ## Summary

There are some text that are hard-coded in the XML files of the project, remove them by extracting them as string resources. Please go through each XML and Java file manually to find hard-coded strings.

Removing hard-coded strings is a good practice to be followed and often developers while developing new features leave them as hard-coded strings only.

## What to do

Do changes locally and then push them to the repository as Pull Request.
