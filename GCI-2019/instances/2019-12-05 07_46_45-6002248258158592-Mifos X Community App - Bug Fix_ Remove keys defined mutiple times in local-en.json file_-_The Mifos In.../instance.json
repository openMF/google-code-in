    "description": "## Objective\nThe objective is to remove the keys defined multiple time in the local-en.json file of the Mifos Community App.\n\n### Description\n\n#### Actual Behaviour:\nThe `keys` in the file local-en.json in the global-translations folder has been defined multiple times which only creates complexity and increased the length of the file. For example, the key `debitaccount` has been defined multiple times in the same file which is of no use. This task aims to decrease the redundancy of the keys in the same file.\n\n#### Expected Behaviour:\nEvery key should be present only once in the file. (apart from those meant for a section's identification)\n\n#### Related files:\nOpen the `local-en.json` file in any text editor(preferably VS Code) and search for the keys repeated in the file. \n\n#### How to Submit\nSubmit a pull request linking to the issue and include the link to the pull request in your submission through the GCI Portal. \n\n## How to get help \nIf you need help, be sure to post your question to our [developer mailing list](http://mifos.org/resources/community/communications/#mailing-lists) or ask in our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/openMF/community-app)."
