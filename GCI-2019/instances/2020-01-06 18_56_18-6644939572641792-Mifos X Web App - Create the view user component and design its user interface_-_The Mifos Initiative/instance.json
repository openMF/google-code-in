Connect it via routing from users table in users component so that its accessible.\n3. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).\n4. Design the user interface for the view user component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness. (Use Angular Material Typography instead of SCSS wherever possible, refer more recently created components for reference)\n5. Fetch the data of the user by implementing the required API.\n6. Implement required API for deletion of user. \r\n7. Write comments for the implemented component.\n\n#### References\nYou may have a look at the current implemented components in `accounting`, `system` or `products` section for reference.\n\n## How to get help \nIf you need help, be sure to post your question to our [developer mailing list](http://mifos.org/resources/community/communications/#mailing-lists) or ask in our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/openMF/web-app).\n\nAll the best!
