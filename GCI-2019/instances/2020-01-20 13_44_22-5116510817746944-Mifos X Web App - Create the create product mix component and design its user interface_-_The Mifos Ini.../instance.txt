Description: ## Objective
The objective is to create the create product mix component and design its user interface. (this will partially fix the mentioned issue ticket)

### Description
1. Create the create product mix component under the products -> products mix section.
2. Connect it via routing from create product mix button in products mix component so that its accessible.
3. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).
4. Design the user interface for the create prouct mix component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness. (See the possibility as mentioned in the issue and implement accordingly if possible)
