Issues in the edit profile activity:

(1) When changing password or passcode, if the user taps the button to see the new password he wants to set, then the `Confirm New Password` editText should disappear because that just removes the need of confirmation since the user could see the text he is typing.

(2) When `Change Email` or `Change Mobile Number` is open, if you tap `Cancel`, the text below `Change Email` (which shows the currently set email/number) disappears. But that doesn't happen when tapping `Change Email` or `Change Mobile Number` again, it works out correctly, showing email/number.
