Title: Mifos X Web App - Create add role component and design its user interface
Description: ## Objective
The objective is to create add role component and design its user interface.

### Description
1. Create a add role component under the system -> roles and permissions section.
2. Connect it via routing from add role button in roles and permissions component so that its accessible.
3. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).
4. Design the user interface for the add role component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness. Make sure the container width is small as the form is short. (See System -> Codes -> Create Code as an example)
5. Implement the required API so a new role can be created. Make sure user is redirected back to Roles and Permissions after role is created.
6. Write comments for the implemented component.

#### References
You may have a look at the current implemented components in `accounting`, `system` or `products` section for reference.
