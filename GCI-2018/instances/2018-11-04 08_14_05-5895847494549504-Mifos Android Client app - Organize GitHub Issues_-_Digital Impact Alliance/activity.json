It's definitely very impressive work you did there.",

Great job! \n\nI found few minor issues that were present in your sheet, can you please fix them? Some issues (e.g issue mentioned in cell 94A) have a pull requests that were sent to them but the pull requests were later closed because they couldn't resolve the issue. In such a case, the issue would have to be classified as \"open\". \n\nI apologize for not mentioning this in the task. Can you please fix these minor errors and then get back to us? \n\nOther than that, everything else is perfect. Amazing work! \\(^_^)/",

I've made some entry testing and everything looks fine for now. I'm not the Python guy, so the code quality might not be amazing, but It gets its job done.\n\nFurthermore, I've run that on my google spreadsheet for the android-client repo, to get this task done and give you some preview. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sysJ09YMN4m8Ex1ZufGfm3iMadkIIX8SKPXPHIlJaAY/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAs you might notice, there is some extra-status-value: 'multiple_prs'. It's because script found multiple, but unique prs reference to currently checked issue. For example: when pr#999, pr#988 and pr#996 reference issue #800 - the status will be 'multiple_prs'. It's sometimes hard to tell if some issue got resolved by any of these references, so I decided to do that in this way.\n\nWould love to get your feedback :)",
