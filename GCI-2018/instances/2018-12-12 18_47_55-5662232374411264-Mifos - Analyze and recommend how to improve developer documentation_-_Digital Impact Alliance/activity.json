Originaly MifosForge - both Confluence and JIRA was used for all of the Mifos-based projects prior to switching to GitHub for issue management. \n\nI do think we should have updated and clear docs for each project in the README like you suggested but we should likewise maintain a consolidated but updated page in MifosForge as well because we still do send people there for docs purposes (although content needs to be streamlined/updated).\n\nOnce you submit this task, if you want we can create another task for implementing this that you could claim. Good luck in the final day and great work thus far along with your engagement and support of the community. \n\nEd",
