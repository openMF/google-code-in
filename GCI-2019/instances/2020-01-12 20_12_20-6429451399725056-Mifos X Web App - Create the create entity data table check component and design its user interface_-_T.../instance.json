    "description": "## Objective\nThe objective is to create the create entity data table check component and design its user interface.\n\n### Description\n1. Create the create entity data table check component under the organization -> entity data table checks section.\n2. Connect it via routing from create entity data table check button in entity data table checks component so that its accessible.\n3. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).\n4. Design the user interface for the create entity data table check component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness. (Implement as a component and not as a dialog box as in community app)\n5. Implement the required API so a new entity data table check can be created. Make sure after entity data table check creation we are redirected back to entity data table check list view.\n6. Write comments for the implemented component.\n\n#### References\nYou may have a look at the current implemented components in `accounting`, `system` or `products` section for reference.\n\n## How to get help \nIf you need help, be sure to post your question to our [developer mailing list](http://mifos.org/resources/community/communications/#mailing-lists) or ask in our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/openMF/web-app).\n\nAll the best! Do remember, quality over quantity is the key."
