We need to expand our catalog for other continents, countries, regions.\n\nFor this task, based on the assigned region, you should search for and find tech hubs, startup accelerators, incubators, startup boot camps, fintech labs, innovation challenges.\n\nThe catalog of innovation hubs by country is at: https://bit.ly/2OYu7HG\n\nAdd the relevant details for fifteen tech hubs to the Google Sheet which can be found in the external URL for this google task."
