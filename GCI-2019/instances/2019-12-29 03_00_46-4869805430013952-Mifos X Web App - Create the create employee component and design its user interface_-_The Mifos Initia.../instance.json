    "description": "## Objective\nThe objective is to create the create employee component and design its user interface.\n\n### Description\n1. Create the create employee component under the orgaization -> manage employee section.\n2. Connect it via routing from create employee button in employees component so that its accessible.\n3. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).\n4. Design the user interface for the create employee component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness. Make sure the container width is small as the form is short. (See Accounting -> Closing Entries -> Create as an example)\n5. Implement the required API so a new employee can be created. Make sure user is redirected back to employees list view after employee is created.\n6. Write comments for the implemented component.\n\n#### References\nYou may have a look at the current implemented components in `accounting`, `system` or `products` section for reference.\n\n## How to get help \nIf you need help, be sure to post your question to our [developer mailing list](http://mifos.org/resources/community/communications/#mailing-lists) or ask in our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/openMF/web-app).\n\nAll the best! Do remember, quality over quantity is the key."
