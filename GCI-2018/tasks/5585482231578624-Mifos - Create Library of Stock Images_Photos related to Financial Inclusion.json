Nonetheless we still need more quality imagery. There a number of good resources online for free, share-able, high quality images like Pixabay and Pexels.\n\nFor this task, you will search for and download relevant images into a shared Google Drive folder at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VwmgJIu1atrluyBrmA-rBA6gGHpDgJTN.
