Title: Mifos X Web App - Create the create adhoc query component and design its user interface
Description: ## Objective
The objective is to create the create adhoc query component and design its user interface.

### Description
1. Create the create adhoc query component under the organization -> adhoc query section.
2. Connect it via routing from create adhoc query button in adhoc query component so that its accessible.
3. Make sure to read the guidelines to replicate a screen from [here](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/wiki/Replicate-an-existing-Community-App-screen-into-the-new-Web-App).
4. Design the user interface for the create adhoc query component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness.
