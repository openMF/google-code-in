    "description": "Summary:\n\nThere should be some checks which are required for when we store cards. Currently, we do not have any checks.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nDashboard -> Saved Cards -> Add Card -> Try different things like leave some TextField empty or input a expired date.\n\nExpected behavior:\n\nThere would be various checks while a user is adding a card like if a user has left any field empty then there would be some error.\n\nObserved behavior:\n\nThere were no checks and user can even store a empty card."
