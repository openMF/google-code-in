Title: Mifos Android Client app - Organize GitHub Issues
Description: ## Objective
This task involves separating opened issues from issues with Pull Requests (PRs) have been sent.

1. Go through the Android Client's [Issues](https://github.com/openMF/android-client/issues)
2. Sort the list by 'Newest'.
3. Check if the status of the issue - whether it has been listed has been referenced by some PR. If not, check if the PR has been sent for it from the [PR](https://github.com/openMF/android-client/pulls)
  a - If PR has been sent and merged - Closed
  b - If PR has been sent - In progress
  c - If PR hasn't been sent - Open

You have to submit a spreadsheet (you can use Microsoft Excel or Libre Office or Google sheets etc) with four columns: 
1. First Column => Links to Issues
2. Second Column => Name ( As stated On Github )
3. Third Column => Status
   a - Green - open
   b - Blue - in progress
   c - Red - closed
4. Fourth Column => Date ( When you last checked the issue's status). 
5. The submission should have at least 10 records. More records will add to the weight of your task. However, duplicate records - adding the same PR more than once - will have a negative effect. 

If you need help, you can either contact the mentor assigned for the task or contact the public channel for the Android Client.
