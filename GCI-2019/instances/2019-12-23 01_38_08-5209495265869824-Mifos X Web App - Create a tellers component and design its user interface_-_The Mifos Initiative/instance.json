Design the user interface for the tellers component using angular material components and flex layout directives to ensure responsiveness.\n5. Fetch the data by implementing the required API and populate the table. Make sure searching and sorting works.\n6. Remove the edit/delete buttons and rename view button to `view cashiers`. \n7. Write comments for the implemented component.\n\n#### References\nYou may have a look at the current implemented components in `accounting`, `system` or `products` section for reference.\n\n## How to get help \nIf you need help, be sure to post your question to our [developer mailing list](http://mifos.org/resources/community/communications/#mailing-lists) or ask in our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/openMF/web-app).\n\nAll the best!
