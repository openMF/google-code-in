Title: Mifos X Community App - Bug Fix: Admin can uncheck "ALL FUNCTION" permission checkbox which removes the admin priviledges.
Description: ### Description:
Admin user is allowed to uncheck "ALL FUNCTION" permission on Permissions: Special screen. It drops the admin privileges for all the other admin users as well.

### Steps to Reproduce:
Login to community app as admin.
Navigate to Admin>>System>>Manage Roles And Permissions and select an admin user. Then on Permission:Special edit screen, uncheck "ALL FUNCTION" checkbox and check "ALL FUNCTION READ" checkbox and save. Now the admin role has only read privileges.

### Expected Behaviour:
"ALL FUNCTION" checkbox should not be editable, as it drops all admin privileges.

### Actual Behaviour:
After unchecking the "ALL FUNCTION" checkbox, admin user does not have write privileges.

Submit a pull request linking to the issue and include the link to the pull request in your submission through the GCI Portal.
