Title: Mifos X Community App - Bug Fix: Remove keys defined mutiple times in local-en.json file
Description: ## Objective
The objective is to remove the keys defined multiple time in the local-en.json file of the Mifos Community App.

### Description

#### Actual Behaviour:
The `keys` in the file local-en.json in the global-translations folder has been defined multiple times which only creates complexity and increased the length of the file. For example, the key `debitaccount` has been defined multiple times in the same file which is of no use. This task aims to decrease the redundancy of the keys in the same file.

#### Expected Behaviour:
Every key should be present only once in the file. (apart from those meant for a section's identification)

#### Related files:
Open the `local-en.json` file in any text editor(preferably VS Code) and search for the keys repeated in the file. 

#### How to Submit
Submit a pull request linking to the issue and include the link to the pull request in your submission through the GCI Portal.
