It drops the admin privileges for all the other admin users as well.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce:\nLogin to community app as admin.\nNavigate to Admin>>System>>Manage Roles And Permissions and select an admin user. Then on Permission:Special edit screen, uncheck \"ALL FUNCTION\" checkbox and check \"ALL FUNCTION READ\" checkbox and save.
